    <p><Strong>Origin</Strong></p>
    <p>The Doctor has a few different origin stories. In one story, The Doctor could be "the Timeless Child", a being from another dimension or universe, who was discovered early in the history on the planet of Gallifrey’s. 
    The Child had a natural ability to regenerate.  The Shobogans(the original inhabitants of Gallifrey) after splicing the timeless child’s DNA and mixing it into their own, eventually became Time Lords. In another origin 
    story the Doctor could be some other form of reincarnation of the “other” a figure from Galifray’s pat who helped the Time Lord’s develop time travel technology. </p>
<p><Strong>Name</Strong></p>
The Doctor’s true name is unmown except for a few people who know is real name. The Time Lords do know his real name, but do not use it. The Eleventh Doctor told his companion Clara Oswald that his real name was not that 
important since he specifically chose in its place the title of "Doctor", "like a promise you make". (TV: The Name of the Doctor) This promise was, as the Tenth and War Doctor recited together, "Never cruel or cowardly. 
Never give up, never give in."   
<p><Strong>Traveling Through Time and Space</Strong></p>
    <p>The doctor travels through space and time in the TARDIS(Time And Relative Dimensions In Space). The TARDIS usually adapts its exterior appears to its surroundings. The Doctor has stated that it is stuck looking 
    like an old police box because of a broken chameleon circuit. It is bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. </p>
